                <h1><strong>Terms of Use</strong></h1>
                <p>Welcome to our online tech store. Please review the following terms and conditions carefully before using our website:</p>

                <h3><strong>1. Acceptance of Terms</strong></h3>
                <p>By accessing this website, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, all applicable laws, and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site.</p>

                <h3><strong>2. Use License</strong></h3>
                <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on our website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title. This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by our store at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</p>

                <h3><strong>3. Intellectual Property Rights</strong></h3>
                <p>All content included on this site, such as text, graphics, logos, button icons, images, audio clips, digital downloads, data compilations, and software, is the property of our online tech store or its content suppliers and protected by international copyright laws. The compilation of all content on this site is the exclusive property of our online tech store, with copyright authorship for this collection by our online tech store, and protected by international copyright laws.</p>

                <h3><strong>4. User Responsibilities</strong></h3>
                <p>As a user of our website, you agree to use the services provided by our online tech store responsibly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You agree not to engage in any activity that could harm, disable, overburden, or impair the proper functioning of our website or any of its services. You also agree not to attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of our website, or to any other user's accounts or data.</p>

                <h3><strong>5. Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
                <p>Your privacy is important to us. Please review our Privacy Policy to understand how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information when you use our website. By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of your information as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h3><strong>6. Limitation of Liability</strong></h3>
                <p>In no event shall our online tech store or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on our website, even if our online tech store or a authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

                <h3><strong>7. Changes to Terms of Use</strong></h3>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms of Use at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

                <h3><strong>8. Governing Law</strong></h3>
                <p>These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Country], and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that location.</p>
